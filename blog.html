            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p>
              This week we got introduced to the project and our team. We set up
              a meeting to introduce ourselves to each other and draft a mail to
              the client requesting a meeting.
            </p>

            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>
              This week we've had our first client meeting with John from IBM
              and Dean Mohamedally from UCL. They introduced us further to the
              project briefing us on the specifics. Based on this we started
              drafting a MoSCoW list in Miro.
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <p>
              This week we finished the MoSCoW list and scheduled a meeting with
              the client to go over what we made. We also created a persona for
              an average user of the software.
            </p>

            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <p>
              We had a second meeting with our client, where we discussed any
              possible changes to our MoSCoW requirements list, and we were
              given a link to a Trello board, where we could post updates about
              our project and attach any necessary files. Furthermore, we
              designed a prototype for the HCI of our system.
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 5</h2>
            <p>
              We completed and submitted the HCI assignment, for which we had to
              evaluate and improve our prototype and use the work we had done up
              until this point to create a HCI report.
            </p>
