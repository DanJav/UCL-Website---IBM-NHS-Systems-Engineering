            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p>
              This week we got introduced to the project and our team. We set up
              a meeting to introduce ourselves to each other and draft a mail to
              the client requesting a meeting.
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>
              This week we've had our first client meeting with John from IBM
              and Dean Mohamedally from UCL. They introduced us further to the
              project briefing us on the specifics. Based on this we started
              drafting a MoSCoW list in Miro.
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <p>
              This week we finished the MoSCoW list and scheduled a meeting with
              the client to go over what we made. We also created a persona for
              an average user of the software.
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <p>
              We had a second meeting with our client, where we discussed any
              possible changes to our MoSCoW requirements list, and we were
              given a link to a Trello board, where we could post updates about
              our project and attach any necessary files. Furthermore, we
              designed a prototype for the HCI of our system.
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 5</h2>
            <p>
              We completed and submitted the HCI assignment, for which we had to
              evaluate and improve our prototype and use the work we had done up
              until this point to create a HCI report.
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 6</h2>
            <p>
This week we started with setting up our environment and researching similar technologies and tools (i.e. Facebook messenger rooms, Houseparty, Next.js etc and other platforms). We made some good progress and we also checked in with our clients and gave them an update.  
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 7</h2>
            <p>
We started doing much of the coding and have tried to finish the “multiple languages” must have in the MoSCow list. We also started implementing a few other MoSCoW features. A significant problem we encountered is how to make our (in development) locally run servers interact with our app.   
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 8</h2>
            <p>
We successfully added the multilingual access feature, and had another meeting with our client, where we discussed the user interface in greater detail. It was suggested to us that we should base future UI design on gerontological studies on creating a user interface tailored towards elderly people. 
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 9</h2>
            <p>
One of our initial requirements was to stream data to NHS, however, following a discussion about privacy concerns with our client, this was changed to logging call data. This week we focused on implementing that feature. 
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 10</h2>
            <p>
We focused on implementing SMS invites, meaning that when a user calls a contact, that contact could also receive an invite to the call through a text message. This was achieved through the use of an external API.  
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 11</h2>
            <p>
We had another meeting with the client where we further discussed possible features, including adding a splash screen when the app is opened, as well as the ability to upload custom backgrounds and set contact profile pictures. We also further extended SMS invites by making them multilingual. 
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 12</h2>
            <p>
We implemented the custom background feature, which would allow users to upload an image from their computer, and then be able to change the app’s background to that image. We also added the ability for these background images to be deleted. 
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 13</h2>
            <p>
We worked on adding a feature to allow users to set profile pictures for contacts.  This was similar to uploading backgrounds, so we were able to base our code around that feature. We also made the presentation and wrote the script for the elevator pitch, and after this we had a meeting with our client where we discussed the contents of this script.  
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 14</h2>
            <p>
We had our elevator pitch presentation this week. As well as this, we had another meeting with the client, where we were told that we should try to integrate our platform with other FISE apps (Concierge and AskBob).  
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 15</h2>
            <p>
In our previous meeting with the client, we were told that it would be impressive if we could show the platform running on different devices. Because of this, we carried out cross-platform functionality testing. 
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 16</h2>
            <p>
We improved the background images feature by allowing users to choose between static or 360° VR images, which can be done by ticking on un-ticking a checkbox on the ‘add new background’ page. Also, we implemented AskBob voice commands, which allow users to, for example, ask for weather forecasts or recipes. We also added the ability for voice commands to execute certain in-app tasks, such as changing the background or calling a contact. 
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 17</h2>
            <p>
As per the client’s request, we designed a splash screen for the app, which would trigger when the app is opened. Also, we added new settings which would allow users to choose between AskBob or IBM Watson voice commands, as well as giving users the option to use local browser speech synthesis. These settings are provided to give users better privacy options, which is an important aspect of our project. 
            </p>

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Week 18</h2>
            <p>
We completed the custom background feature by adding an option to upload an image with a URL when adding a background. Also, we worked on creating a HTML page that displays plugins in the app, which could potentially display many different types of content, such as games, videos, news feeds, etc. 
            </p>
            <h2>Week 19</h2>
            <p>
We added the emergency message feature, which someone in distress could use to record a short message that would be sent to all of their contacts. Also, we made a list of HTML5 games that could be used as plugins so that we could demonstrate the potential of this idea. 
            </p>
                        <h2>Week 20</h2>
            <p>
This week we focused on testing the code in order to ensure that the changes we made are robust and to check for any potential improvements before our TA presentation and our code review. We did a significant amount of work on our report website. Our client also suggested that it would be beneficial if the app was easily deployable, which is something we would focus on during the next week. 
            </p>
                        <h2>Week 21</h2>
            <p>
We finished our work on making the platform easily deployable. Furthermore, we wrote a script for our TA presentation and recorded our meeting for our portfolio. 
            </p>
                        <h2>Week 22</h2>
            <p>
had our code review, where we explained and demonstrated the features or our app. After this, we prioritised cleaning up our report website, as well as writing the script for and recording our 2-minute video.
