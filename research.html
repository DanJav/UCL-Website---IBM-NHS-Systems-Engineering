              As our task is to build a social video calling platform, we have
              conducted research on existing <b>similiar applications</b> and
              what <b>technologies</b> we believe are needed for our purposes.
              We have had discussions with the client to determine what similiar
              applications and technologies we should investigate.

            <p>
              Houseparty is a free video social networking app that allows you
              to video chat with up to 8 friends in “rooms” and play games
              together. Its popularity has exploded during the covid-19 crisis.

                <b>Take-aways</b>
                <li>Games should be easily available from a drop-down menu.</li>
                <li>
                  A key usability aspect of games is the in-synch feature for
                  all users => We need to minimize delay between what users see.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Games seem to be a little bit overcomplicated. It is not clear
                  in certain situations whose turn it is or how should the game
                  be played => Make games intuitive, add tooltips when the user
                  seems lost (i.e., lack of input), easy interface for games is
                  important as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Icons are custom, very suggestive but their uniqueness can be
                  a bit confusing => our app should have more commonly used SVGs
                  for the vital functionalities.
                </li>
                <li>Responsiveness is a key aspect.</li>
                <li>
                  Easy to add friends, we should try to further simplify this
                  process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Easy to connect with contacts from other applications such as
                  Snapchat, Whatsapp, etc. It is a very important feature =>
                  somehow allow users to connect with email and whatsapp
                  contacts at least: could use Whatsapp API:
                </li>
                <li>Icons should be suggestive and easy to see.</li>
                <li>
                  Main menu should include the vital operations of usability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We need a bit more spark of colour in the UI like Houseparty
                  has. Our app is not for business use => Users should derive
                  joy visually.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ability to change the background is not so great which makes
                  the feature unusable => We should strike for something better,
                  similar to Snapchat’s.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Number of users per room is a bit low for an app designed for
                  group of friends.
                </li>
                <li>No scheduled invitations, which is a must-do.</li>

                <li>
                  Very easy to contact friends (synchronized with Facebook
                  contacts) => should include the ability to synch Facebook
                  contacts as it is a very used and easy to log with (optional
                  for users to do so).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Room Topic is a great idea = ability to add the topic and
                  reason of the meeting users create => add room category as
                  part of the “Create a room” process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Start time for a meeting is a great feature. Makes the
                  scheduling system easier than in Zoom for example. Very easy
                  to set the “Meeting time” to “Now” in case user gets lost!
                </li>
                <li>
                  All meeting settings for a “Create Meeting” process appear on
                  the same pop-up which makes it very clear from the beginnings
                  what the steps for setting up a meeting are => should use this
                  as well!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Emogis as SVGs is great and very intuitive for room topic and
                  other, as they are commonly used and understood by a large
                  group of people (even elderly understand emogis).
                </li>
                <li>
                  For every popup there exists a “Go back”, “Undo” and “Cancel”
                  button that is highlighted in grey making it very easy to see
                  => more generally we should add navigation buttons to all
                  popovers and highlight them.

                <li>
                  Transparent design for buttons which gives depth to the

            <h2>React</h3>
            <p>
              A key part of the project is altering Jitsi’s UI, for which we
              needed to choose a JavaScript framework or library. The two most
              widely used libraries/frameworks in this field are React, which is
              an open-source library, and Angular, which is a framework. For
              this project, we have decided to keep using React. routes and
              scalability.
            </p>

            <p><b> Advantages of React </b></p>

            <p>
              The main advantage of React is that it’s
              <b>smaller in size</b> than Angular, which is very popular web
              framework. This means that on average less Javascript code has to
              be sent and run by the client, which makes a noticebale
              performance difference for devices with small memory sizes or
              slower internet connection. React is also
              <b>easier to start with</b>
              if the programmer has prior knowledge of JavaScript as it relies
              on common Javascript patterns, oposed to Angular which introduces
              a lot of complex desgins such as dependency injection which may
              prove unnecessary for medium sized projects. React provides enough
              advantages to make the achievement of our project requirements due
              to its ease of use, all while providing the tools necessary to
              complete the project due to its compatibility with third party
              modules.
            </p>
            <p>
              React also has a <b>virtual DOM</b> (Document Object Model)
              implementation. The virtual DOM holds the reactive state of the
              components that gets managed at Javascript runtime, which is
              different form the actual rendering time of the DOM. This limits
              the frequency of updates to the actual DOM, making it faster and
              more suitable for a video calling application that requires high
              responsiveness and less processing overhead for the devices it
              runs on. app.
            </p>
            <p>
              React is very useful at improving <b>development efficiency</b>.
              Firstly, React components give the project extensibility by
              allowing developers to reuse code in different context. This
              improves readability and code quality overall as a tested and
              functional component can be reused in multiple parts of the
              project with the confidence of not introducing bugs. Also, this
              gives structure to complex web code bases wthat tend to be written
              in a very procedural manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>large toolset</b> of 3rd party libraries available for
              React is very helpful when developing large projects. Since React
              is a JavaScript library it allows the usage of most vanilla
              Javascript plugins which reduces development time, allowing
              developers to focus on new features rather than recreating already
              available functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, React is the more realistic option, due to the afore
              mentioned arguments, accessibility and use of plain JavaScript.
            </p>

            <!-- Next.js -->

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h2>Next.js</h3>
            <p>
              Next.js is a framework built on top of React that will empower us
              to create an even more performant and reactive application while
              reducing the complexity of the code. Some of the most important
              features of Next.js include automatic bundling using webpack,
              code-splitting, page-based routing, server-side rendering, API
              routes and scalability.
            </p>

            <p><b> Performance </b></p>

            <p>
              Performance is one of the most important factors for our choice.
              React requires difficult techniques for optimization. Next.js
              simplifies this process.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Automatic code-splitting</b> is a Next.js feature that
              dramatically improves loading times of pages by dynamically
              loading JavaScript code that is packaged into bundles. With
              Next.js’s file system based routing we are free to scale our
              application while affecting the load times of our pages. When a
              specific route is requested by the client, Next.js will load that
              specific JavaScript bundle that corresponds to the requested
              route, thus not overloading the client with unused code. These
              bundles are automatically created by Next.js using webpack which
              includes optimization features by determining which code is shared
              across certain components.
            </p>

            <p>
              One other feature that improves the loading time of the
              application is <b>dynamic import</b>. Certain libraries may be
              needed only when a certain action is done by the user, therefore
              Next.js supports dynamic import which can load JavaScript code
              when the user triggers certain actions, such as the click of a
              button.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Pre-rendering</b> is what makes a difference when using Next.js
              with React. By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means
              that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of
              having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Thus, this is solves
              the previously mentioned disadvantage of using React for
              static-generated pages. Moreover, pre-rendering can result in
              better performance and SEO.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code
              necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its
              JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. Next.js
              has two forms of pre-rendering: <b> Static Generation </b> and
              <b> Server-side Rendering </b>. The difference is in when it
              generates the HTML for a page. Static Generation generates HTML
              build time reusing it for each request, while the other generates
              HTML on each request. likely to lose support from their company.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another important aspect of this framework is the
              <b>caching mechanism</b> for remote fetches. Vercel, the creator
              of Next.js provides a very lightweight library, named SWR, that
              improves the fetching mechanism in React. The name “SWR” is
              derived from stale-while-revalidate, a HTTP cache invalidation
              strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. SWR is a strategy to first
              return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request
              (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data. In the
              context of our project, SWR server a very important role in
              adapting the application to the Progressive Web Application (PWA)
              standard that would allow it to run "offline" (without the use of
              internet services). This enables us to create a PWA that can be
              installed added to devices' home screens even if it is a web app.
            </p>
            <p><b> Deployment </b></p>
            <p>
              Since our base code has already been designed to function well
              with the Vercel deployment system (as recommended by Next.js on
              their website), Next.js makes a great choice. The process is very
              easy requiring only the repository of the Next.js app and the
              configuration data to be copied to Vercel. This will facilitate
              our production testing iterations by reducing the time taken to
              redeploy and reconfigure our Next.js application for production.
              Easy to deploy using Vercel, the creator of Next.js. But gives the
              option of deploying on every server that has Node.js, thus
              allowing us to fulfil our requirement of deploying on a remote
              server for users to be served the application seamlessly.

            <h2>Docker</h3>
            <p>
              Docker is a platform that enables your application to be deployed,
              shipped and run on different systems and environments without
              changing the source code. This is achieved by isolating the app
              from the environment of the machine that is running on (host
              machine). Those isolated environments are called
              <b>containers</b> which can run quickly, securely and reliably
              with all the needed dependencies. Docker is the industry standard
              for container-based applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Containers can be built from Docker <b>images</b> which represent
              immutable snapshots of software packages such as Ubuntu, Node.js
              and many others. Thus, a container can be constructed to run
              multiple software packages from multiple images without needing to
              install them on the host machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another very important feature is the <b>Docker Compose API</b>.
              Docker Compose allows multiple containers to communicate at
              runtime, thus giving the possibility of running parts of the
              application from multiple environments. Docker inserts the
              containers in their own local network that runs on the Docker
              Host, separate from the network of the host machine. This enables
              an application to have a server container that communicates with a
              client container in a secure, isolated environment.
            </p>
            <p><b> Deployment </b></p>
            <p>
              In the context of our project, Docker is very useful in achieving
              <b>cross-platform functionality</b>. More exactly, Docker would
              allow clients to deploy the application consisting of the
              client-side, server-side and database locally on the consumer
              device without detriment to the features. Moreover, Docker
              containers are very lightweight as they share the machine’s OS
              system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application.
              This allows our application to
              <b>run on lower-end hardware</b> and devices without consuming
              resources unnecessarily.
            </p>
            <p><b> Privacy & Security </b></p>
            <p>
              Since Docker enables our application to run entirely locally, the
              communication between client-server and server-database in the
              <b>cloud is removed</b>. In addition, Docker containers are very
              secure as they operate within their own
              <b>isolated environment and network</b>. Most important security
              features include: containers have their own namespace in the
              kernel which means docker containers cannot see and interact with
              host machine processes, limted attack surface of the Docker Engine
              and restricted root access of the container processes on host
              machine.
