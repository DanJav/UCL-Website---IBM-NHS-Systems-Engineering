              As our task is to build a social video calling platform, we have
              conducted research on existing <b>similiar applications</b> and
              what <b>technologies</b> we believe are needed for our purposes.
              We have had discussions with the client to determine what similiar
              applications and technologies we should investigate.

            <p>
              Houseparty is a free video social networking app that allows you
              to video chat with up to 8 friends in “rooms” and play games
              together. Its popularity has exploded during the covid-19 crisis.

                <b>Take-aways</b>
                <li>Games should be easily available from a drop-down menu.</li>
                <li>
                  A key usability aspect of games is the in-synch feature for
                  all users => We need to minimize delay between what users see.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Games seem to be a little bit overcomplicated. It is not clear
                  in certain situations whose turn it is or how should the game
                  be played => Make games intuitive, add tooltips when the user
                  seems lost (i.e., lack of input), easy interface for games is
                  important as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Icons are custom, very suggestive but their uniqueness can be
                  a bit confusing => our app should have more commonly used SVGs
                  for the vital functionalities.
                </li>
                <li>Responsiveness is a key aspect.</li>
                <li>
                  Easy to add friends, we should try to further simplify this
                  process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Easy to connect with contacts from other applications such as
                  Snapchat, Whatsapp, etc. It is a very important feature =>
                  somehow allow users to connect with email and whatsapp
                  contacts at least: could use Whatsapp API:
                </li>
                <li>Icons should be suggestive and easy to see.</li>
                <li>
                  Main menu should include the vital operations of usability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We need a bit more spark of colour in the UI like Houseparty
                  has. Our app is not for business use => Users should derive
                  joy visually.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ability to change the background is not so great which makes
                  the feature unusable => We should strike for something better,
                  similar to Snapchat’s.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Number of users per room is a bit low for an app designed for
                  group of friends.
                </li>
                <li>No scheduled invitations, which is a must-do.</li>

                <b>Take-aways</b>
                <li>
                  Very easy to contact friends (synchronized with Facebook
                  contacts) => should include the ability to synch Facebook
                  contacts as it is a very used and easy to log with (optional
                  for users to do so).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Room Topic is a great idea = ability to add the topic and
                  reason of the meeting users create => add room category as
                  part of the “Create a room” process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Start time for a meeting is a great feature. Makes the
                  scheduling system easier than in Zoom for example. Very easy
                  to set the “Meeting time” to “Now” in case user gets lost!
                </li>
                <li>
                  All meeting settings for a “Create Meeting” process appear on
                  the same pop-up which makes it very clear from the beginnings
                  what the steps for setting up a meeting are => should use this
                  as well!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Emogis as SVGs is great and very intuitive for room topic and
                  other, as they are commonly used and understood by a large
                  group of people (even elderly understand emogis).
                </li>
                <li>
                  For every popup there exists a “Go back”, “Undo” and “Cancel”
                  button that is highlighted in grey making it very easy to see
                  => more generally we should add navigation buttons to all
                  popovers and highlight them.

                <li>
                  Transparent design for buttons which gives depth to the

            <h2>Technology review</h2>

            <!-- Next.js -->

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h3>Next.js</h3>
            <p>
              Next.js is a framework built on top of React that will empower us
              to create an even more performant and reactive application while
              reducing the complexity of the code. Some of the most important
              features of Next.js include automatic bundling using webpack,
              code-splitting, page-based routing, server-side rendering, API
              routes and scalability.
            </p>

            <p><b> Performance </b></p>

            <p>
              Performance is one of the most important factors for our choice.
              React requires difficult techniques for optimization. Next.js
              simplifies this process
            </p>
            <p>
              Automatic code-splitting is a Next.js feature that dramatically
              improves loading times of pages by dynamically loading JavaScript
              code that is packaged into bundles. With Next.js’s file system
              based routing we are free to scale our application while affecting
              the load times of our pages. When a specific route is requested by
              the client, Next.js will load that specific JavaScript bundle that
              corresponds to the requested route, thus not overloading the
              client with unused code. These bundles are automatically created
              by Next.js using webpack which includes optimization features by
              determining which code is shared across certain components.
            </p>
            <p>
              One other feature that improves the loading time of the
              application is dynamic import. Certain libraries may be needed
              only when a certain action is done by the user, therefore Next.js
              supports dynamic import which can load JavaScript code when the
              user triggers certain actions, such as the click of a button.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pre-rendering is what makes a difference when using Next.js with
              React. By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that
              Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having
              it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in
              better performance and SEO.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code
              necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its
              JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. Next.js
              has two forms of pre-rendering: <b> Static Generation </b> and
              <b> Server-side Rendering </b>. The difference is in
              <b> when </b> it generates the HTML for a page: Static Generation
              generates HTML build time reusing it for each request, while the
              other generates HTML on each request.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another important aspect of this framework is the caching
              mechanism for remote fetches. Vercel, the creator of Next.js
              provides a very lightweight library, named SWR, that improves the
              fetching mechanism in React. The name “SWR” is derived from
              stale-while-revalidate, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy
              popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. SWR is a strategy to first return
              the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request
              (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data. In the
              context of our application, SWR server a very important role in
              caching data …
            </p>
            <p><b> Deployment </b></p>
            <p>
              Since our base code has already been designed to function well
              with the Vercel deployment system (as recommended by Next.js on
              their website), Next.js makes a great choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              The process is very easy requiring only the repository of the
              Next.js app and the configuration data to be copied to Vercel.
              This will facilitate our production testing iterations by reducing
              the time taken to redeploy and reconfigure our Next.js applciation
              for production. Easy to deploy using Vercel, the creator of
              Next.js. But gives the option of deploying on every server that
              has Node.js.
            </p>

            <!-- React -->

            <hr class="minor" />

            <h3>React</h3>
            <p>
              A key part of the project is altering Jitsi’s UI, for which we
              needed to choose a JavaScript framework or library. The two most
              widely used libraries/frameworks in this field are React, which is
              an open-source library, and Angular, which is a framework. For
              this project, we have decided to keep using React.
            </p>

            <p><b> Advantages of React </b></p>

            <p>
              The main advantage of React is that it’s smaller than Angular and
              easier to get used to if the programmer has prior knowledge of
              JavaScript. Using React will make achieving the requirements of
              the project more realistic due to its ease of use, all while
              providing the tools necessary to complete the project due to its
              compatibility with third party modules. The disadvantage of having
              to import modules, however, is that our team has to make sure that
              these stay consistent throughout the code. On the other hand,
              React also has a virtual DOM (Document Object Model)
              implementation, which limits the frequency of updates to the
              actual DOM, making it faster and more suitable for a video calling
              app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Angular is a framework, so any necessary features will likely
              already be within it, and not needing to import modules would make
              using it more consistent. However, it is much larger, and
              typically written in TypeScript, a language that builds on
              JavaScript. This means that it would be significantly more
              difficult to learn and would take longer to get started with.

              React is owned by Facebook, while Angular is owned by Google, both
              of which are known for shutting down projects for various reasons,
              e.g. profitability. From a stability perspective, both are equally
              likely to lose support from their company.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, React is the more realistic option, mainly due to its
              accessibility and use of plain JavaScript over TypeScript.
